# Project 8: Conduct a study on access to drinking water using Tableau Desktop 2022.4

## Objectives: 
Conduct a study on the global access to drinking water through data visualization using Tableau Desktop 2022.4

## Mission: 
Create a dashboard to identify countries that are experiencing difficulties accessing drinking water to target for funding. The dashboard will present a global view of access to drinking water around the world selecting indicators related to our 3 areas of expertise below:
- Creation of services for access to drinking water
- Modernization of existing water access services
- Consulting with administrations/governments on water access policies.
  
## Data source
- FAO data on population and political insatbility (2000- 2018).
- WHO data on basic and safely managed drinking water services (2000 - 2017) and mortality rate attributed to water (2016)

## Data preparation
- Build data dictionary or metadat repository which is a centralized repository of information about all the datasets.
- Create blueprint for indicator definition and the type of graph required such as map, bar chart, stacked chart, scatter plot, group bar chart, line grapgh, and table.
- Design wireframes or mockups using Figma for the 3 dashboards pages: global, continental, and national
- Convert the 4 excel files to csv. file
  
## Data analysis
- Import the 4 csv. files on population, country, political stability, mortality rate, and basic water services into Jupyter Notebook using Python programming
- Clean the data by checking for duplicates, missing values, and incoherences in datasets
- Merge 
- Export cleaned files tp csv.file
- Import the csv. file into Tableau desktop to build connection and data visualisation.
- Plot the relevant graphs.

## Insights

- The continent with the highest percentage of deaths due to Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) is Africa; with highest occurence in Chad
- Eastern Mediteterranean has the least percentage of population using safely managed drinking water services in rural area.

- Africa has the least perecentage of population using basic drinking water services in rural area.
- Yemen has the worst political instability in the world.

- Chad has approximately 46% of its population living in the rural area have access to basic drinking water services.

## Recommendations
-  Access to drinking water should be improved in Chad given that it has the highest WASH deaths on the continent of Africa.
-  The political instability is not too bad as compared to other African countries like South Sudan and Libya.
-  Feasility studies should be carried out to assess the existing water access services if there is need for modernisation and the level of insecurity.
-  Administrations/governments should be consulted on water access policies.
